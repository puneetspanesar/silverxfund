Hyderabad, India – November 22, 2024 – SilverX Fund, the second fund from the team at Silverneedle Ventures, officially launched on November 21, 2024, at T-Hub, Hyderabad. The event brought together India's startup ecosystem—founders, investors, and industry leaders—to mark the beginning of a new chapter in deep-tech venture capital.
About SilverX Fund
SilverX Fund is raising $90 million (with a $23 million greenshoe option) to deploy high-conviction capital into AI-first, deep-tech, and consumer technology startups at the Seed+ to Series A/B stages. The fund aims to back approximately 20 category-defining companies over its investment period, with first cheque sizes ranging from $1-2 million and 60% of the corpus reserved for follow-on investments.
"SilverX Fund represents our evolution as investors," said Ajay Jain, Founder & Managing Partner. "Building on the learnings from Fund 1, which achieved a 1.6x MOIC within two years, we're now positioned to make deeper, more concentrated bets on founders building the infrastructure and platforms that will define India's next decade."
Investment Thesis: Backing Category Definers
SilverX Fund's investment mandate centers on identifying inflection points where technological capabilities, market timing, and founder excellence converge. The fund focuses on four key themes:

AI Natives: Developer platforms, horizontal and vertical AI applications, and consumer AI solutions
Deep Technology: Patent and IP-driven companies with defensible innovation
Sunrise Sectors: Quantum computing, advanced materials, and semiconductors
Consumer Technology: Mass-adoption platforms with strong unit economics and capital-efficient scaling

Key verticals include social commerce, fintech, and the creator economy.

Fund 1 Track Record
SilverX Fund builds on the success of Silverneedle Ventures' first fund, a SEBI-registered Category I AIF that deployed INR 76 crores within two years across 16 investments. The fund achieved a 1.6x MOIC and backed breakout companies including OnFinance (AI-native solutions), SuperK (consumer mass adoption), and Dhruva Space (deep-tech/space-tech).
Key learnings from Fund 1 have shaped the strategy for Fund 2, including:

Concentrated portfolio approach for deeper founder partnerships
Focus on defensible moats and well-rounded teams
Backing potential category leaders early in their journey
Maintaining consequential ownership positions

Operator-Led Philosophy
SilverX Fund differentiates itself through an operator-led approach, providing value beyond capital:

Active Portfolio Management: Board seats and observer roles with hands-on mentoring
Sales & GTM Acceleration: First-hand support across India and global markets
M&A & Capital Raise Support: Assistance with next-round fundraising and strategic deals
Operations & HR: Access to the SNV network for team building and operational streamlining

Why Now: India's AI-First Decade
"India is at a critical inflection point," noted Dhiraj Sinha, Managing Partner. "As deglobalization reshapes supply chains and technological sovereignty becomes imperative, there's an unprecedented opportunity to build core IP and sovereign infrastructure. The five sectors we've identified—eldercare tech, data centers, AI lending, AI diagnostics, and EDA & semiconductors—represent a combined market opportunity exceeding $583 billion by 2033."
Early-stage venture capital has consistently outperformed other asset classes in India, delivering 29.5% net IRR and 3.9x DPI for funds from the 2015-18 vintage period, compared to 24.2% IRR for private equity and 12-17% CAGR for public markets.


Looking Ahead
With Fund 1's proven track record and an expanded corpus, SilverX Fund is positioned to make larger, more concentrated bets on India's most promising deep-tech startups. The fund will officially begin deployment following SEBI registration in March 2026.
"This is just the beginning," said Ajay Jain. "We're here to back the founders who aren't just participating in markets—they're defining them. The next decade belongs to India's AI-first and deep-tech innovators, and we're committed to being their long-term partners."
